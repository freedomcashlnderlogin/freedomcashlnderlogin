Payday loans often require only hours to complete and some may provide instant cash payouts.

The fastest payouts come from local lenders that accept in-person applications and can hand over cash on the spot. Online lenders must transfer money digitally into your bank account, which typically takes at least one business day to complete.

The application process takes only minutes to complete, whether online or in person. Since many lenders don’t require a credit check for approval, you can often complete your application simply by adding a copy of a recent paycheck stub that shows your regular and year-to-date earnings.

The lender will use this information, as well as your pay frequency, to decide how much of a loan — if any — you’ll qualify for. This will also determine how soon you’ll have to repay the loan.

Most payday loans call for repayment in full on your next payday. That could mean a loan with a term of 15 to 30 days.
